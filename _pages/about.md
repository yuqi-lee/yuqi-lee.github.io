[I](https://yuqi-lee.github.io) am a master student at University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in computer science and technology. My research interests include RDMA/CXL-based disaggregated memory system, operating system (especially memory management) and resource scheduling in cloud computing.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
